The future is a mystery. There is no an absolute certainty about what will happen tomorrow. Many times we know the starting point, the beginning of the path, but we will never know where life will take us. A college degree es a huge compromise and sacrifice, a very long tunnel where we cannot see the light until the end. But maybe we can.  We are introducing LinkedIn Scrapper. It does not matter if you are a former student, a college student or maybe your in high school, you are going to be able to take a look at where are the former students working, and of course, where you can put the eye on (there are some ones working in the big companies like Google and microsoft). Maybe with the information that we will share with you, you can set your goals and your future career path.

As my classmate mentioned before, our Project is called LInkedin Scrapper, in this part of the video, I am going to give you more details about how it works.
This project has four parts. In the first one we are going to use a technique called web scrapping.
With the programming language Python we Will cr√©ate a program that is going to use this technique to get the information we need from the platform Linkedin.
This information will be cleaned in order to get the exact users we want and after that we will placed it in a database in my SQL.
From the database we are planning to get three fields.
The first one is the company these people have worked for, the second one for how long they have been working in a certain company and the last one, the role they have played in the company.
We will get the first two fields with a statistycal analysis, for the last field we will use the natural language processing.
When we finish this part of the process, that means that we have all the results we need, now We need to find a way to show this results to the user.
For this we are going to use a web page, the user will be able to interact with this page and select certain filters in order to get the information he or she needs.
